\begin{document}
This is the Open Dyslexia font.
Allegedly, it was designed so that the letters have a `gravity' to
them which helps to anchor them to the baseline and thus prevent them
jumping about on the page (this being one of the ways that dyslexia
can show itself).
I'm not so sure that it's working.
